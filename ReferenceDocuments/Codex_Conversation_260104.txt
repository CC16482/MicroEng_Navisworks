Get familiar with the project


Got familiar with the repo and skimmed the core project files + reference docs. Here’s the quick map I have:

Core plugin/project + deploy: MicroEng.Navisworks.csproj (net48, WPF + WinForms, ProgramData deploy, .addin in plugins root).
Add‑in entry points + window routing: MicroEngPlugins.cs (panel, Data Scraper, Data Mapper, Data Matrix, Space Mapper, logging/assembly resolve).
Space Mapper engine/UI stack: SpaceMapperService.cs, SpaceMapperControl.xaml, step pages; spatial index + preflight/estimation in SpatialHashGrid.cs and SpaceMapperPresetLogic.cs.
Data Scraper & Matrix pipeline: DataScraperService.cs + DataMatrixControl.xaml (grid pivots cached ScrapeSession data).
UI/theme system + branding: MicroEngWpfUiTheme.cs, MicroEngWpfUiRoot.xaml, MICROENG_THEME_GUIDE.md, Logos/.
Reference specs in use: Space_Mapper_Instructions.txt, Space_Mapper-UpdatedAdditions_04.txt, Sequence4D_UpdatedAdditions_01.txt (note: visible encoding artifacts in these docs).
Recent Space Mapper focus from AGENTS.md: Fast preset origin‑point containment, preflight signature updates, new Benchmark & Testing section, and writeback performance options in Step 3.

Want me to dive deeper anywhere? Suggested next steps:

Trace the Space Mapper run/preflight/writeback path end‑to‑end.
Map the Data Scraper → Data Matrix → Append/Integrate flow.
Review the Sequence4D spec and propose how it would fit into the existing add‑ins.
Follow direcctions form this file to create our new tool - make sure it follows WPF UI like the rest of the project - take the code and dirrections and make sure to make it all work with the rest of the project

ReferenceDocuments\Sequence4D_UpdatedAdditions_01.txt


Implemented the 4D Sequence tool as a WPF‑UI dock pane and wired it into the MicroEng panel/Add‑Ins so it behaves like the rest of the plugin suite. Core Timeliner generation logic now lives in Sequence4DGenerator.cs alongside Sequence4DModels.cs and Sequence4DModelItemUtils.cs, with the WPF UI in Sequence4DControl.xaml and Sequence4DControl.xaml.cs (selection capture, ordering, timings, generate/delete, log). Integration is handled in Sequence4DPlugins.cs, MicroEngPlugins.cs, and the panel button/state updates in MicroEngPanelControl.xaml plus MicroEngPanelControl.xaml.cs. I also added the Timeliner reference in MicroEng.Navisworks.csproj and noted the tool in README.md.

Tests not run (no build executed).

If you want to verify, here are good next steps:

dotnet build MicroEng.Navisworks/MicroEng.Navisworks.csproj /p:NavisApiDir="C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Navisworks Manage 2025"
In Navisworks: Add‑Ins → “4D Sequence Tool (MicroEng)”, capture selection, generate tasks, then confirm they show in TimeLiner and that delete‑by‑name works.
Lets get back to space mapper for now - implement instructions from ReferenceDocuments\Space_Mapper-UpdatedAdditions_10.txt


Implemented the new bounds‑mode logic end‑to‑end: the CPU engine now classifies by zone/target bounds modes (midpoint point tests, plane‑based fallbacks, and partial gating), target bounds generation respects midpoint mode, and comparisons now benchmark/report the new bounds settings instead of presets. Geometry building no longer drops zones that lack planes so Hull/K‑DOP can fall back to AABB when planes are missing.

Details:

SpaceMapperEngines.cs: added bounds‑mode resolution and point containment helpers, switched classification to use bounds modes (with plane fallback + sample points), updated target‑major to use zone bounds mode, and made target bounds creation honor TargetMidpointMode.
SpaceMapperComparisonRunner.cs: variants now specify zone/target bounds modes; midpoint forces partials off; reports/markdown include bounds settings; plane warnings now depend on plane‑based zone modes.
SpaceMapperService.cs: stopped requiring planes by default so zones without planes stay eligible.
I didn’t run a build here. If you want to verify, good next steps are:

dotnet build /p:DeployToProgramData=false
Run the Step 3 benchmark and confirm the report shows zone/target bounds modes and midpoint behavior.

make sure the writing for the sliders is inline with the dashes


Aligned the bounds slider labels to the tick marks by switching to grids that anchor labels on tick boundaries instead of centered columns. This keeps each label directly under its dash.

Updated file:

SpaceMapperStepProcessingPage.xaml
No build/test run. If you want, I can also tweak spacing further based on a screenshot after you check it.

we've added a lot of functionality for benchamrking that doesnt appear in processing mode e.g. skip/pack/show internal/close other windows/write back strat which need to be reflected in processing mode somewhere approprate


Moved the writeback-related controls into the Processing Mode card so they show up alongside the rest of the run settings, instead of being buried in Benchmark & Testing.

Updated:

SpaceMapperStepProcessingPage.xaml
If you want, I can also add a short hint in the Benchmark card that these writeback options live under Processing Mode.

implement instructions from ReferenceDocuments\Space_Mapper-UpdatedAdditions_11.txt


Wired the new Zone Containment Engine + Resolution Strategy settings end‑to‑end and updated selection logic to honor most‑specific/largest‑overlap/first‑match, with mesh‑accurate now forcing midpoint targets and disabling partials (still bounds fallback per hint). This keeps UI, preflight, engine, writeback, and comparison reports in sync.

UI/settings/plumbing in SpaceMapperControl.xaml.cs for new combos, hint text, midpoint enforcement, and calibration key updates.
Strategy‑aware best‑zone selection in SpaceMapperEngines.cs and SpaceMapperService.cs.
Preflight signature + target bounds resolution updates in SpaceMapperPreflightService.cs.
Comparison runner selection + report fields in SpaceMapperComparisonRunner.cs.
Tests not run.

Next steps:

Run dotnet build /p:DeployToProgramData=false.
In Step 3, toggle Mesh accurate to confirm target bounds locks to Midpoint and partial options disable, then run with multi‑zone off to validate Most specific / Largest overlap / First match behavior.
Run a benchmark report to confirm new settings are captured in the variant settings section.
implement instructions from ReferenceDocuments\Space_Mapper-UpdatedAdditions_12.txt


Reworked Step 3 Processing into the vertical card flow from the spec and consolidated advanced writeback/performance toggles into the advanced expander while keeping all existing control names. Added UI state logic so midpoint hides partial handling, mesh accurate shows the fallback-bounds note/label, and the behaviour fields panel only appears when tagging partials is enabled.

SpaceMapperStepProcessingPage.xaml: reorganized into Containment Accuracy, Assignment, Writeback Output, Performance & Optimization (with advanced expander), and Zone Offsets; added the new note/panel containers.
SpaceMapperStepProcessingPage.xaml.cs: added UpdateProcessingUiState and a Loaded hook to manage midpoint/mesh/behaviour visibility.
SpaceMapperControl.xaml.cs: UpdateZoneBehaviorInputs now refreshes the processing UI state after toggle changes.
Tests not run (not requested).

If you want, next steps:

dotnet build /p:DeployToProgramData=false
Open Step 3 and verify midpoint hides partials, mesh accurate shows the fallback bounds note, and the behaviour fields panel toggles with “Write Zone Behaviour property”.
lets remove benchmarking and preflight - ive got the numbers i need


Removed the visible preflight and benchmarking sections from the Processing UI while keeping index granularity and advanced options available; also defaulted reuse‑preflight off to align with the removal.

SpaceMapperStepProcessingPage.xaml updates the “Performance & Optimization” card copy, keeps the Index Granularity slider visible, and collapses the Estimate/Preflight + Benchmark blocks (with ReusePreflightToggleControl defaulting to unchecked).
Tests not run (not requested).

If you want the backend preflight/benchmark logic stripped out as well (handlers/services/reporting), say the word and I’ll remove it.

User attachment
ok but make suure these settings are still accessible


Kept those writeback performance settings visible outside the advanced expander so they’re always accessible.

SpaceMapperStepProcessingPage.xaml now shows Skip/Pack/Show internal/Close panes + tip directly under the Performance & Optimization card.
Want me to move that block into the Writeback Output card instead, or keep it here?

if the zones are in the target objects will it ignore them?


Short answer: no, it won’t ignore them right now. Zones and targets are resolved independently, and the target list is only de‑duplicated within itself, not against zones. So if an item appears in both, it will still be treated as a target (and can map to itself). See SpaceMapperService.cs (line 1265) and SpaceMapperService.cs (line 1318).

If you want, I can add an automatic “exclude zone items from targets” filter (by ItemKey) or a toggle for it.

have it as a toggle


Added a Processing toggle to ignore zone items when they also appear in targets, wired through settings so the filter is applied during resolve and cached signatures stay consistent.

UI toggle lives in the Assignment card under “Target filtering” in SpaceMapperStepProcessingPage.xaml (checkbox: “Ignore zones that are also targets”).
Setting flows through SpaceMapperStepProcessingPage.xaml.cs and SpaceMapperControl.xaml.cs into SpaceMapperModels.cs.
Filtering happens in SpaceMapperService.cs and the preflight signature now includes the flag in SpaceMapperPreflightService.cs.
Tests not run (not requested).

Is this still needed? how does it effect containment accuracy settings


It’s still used, but only for performance. Index Granularity controls the spatial hash grid cell size (candidate search). It does not change containment accuracy — the actual containment test still comes from your engine (bounds vs mesh) and target/zone bounds modes. Smaller cells reduce candidate pairs (faster queries) but cost more to build; larger cells do the opposite. Results should be the same, just different speed/memory.

If you want to simplify, you can default it to Auto and hide the slider without changing accuracy.

yes sounds good - default it to Auto and hide the slider without changing accuracy


Done. The Index Granularity UI block is now hidden (collapsed), and it still defaults to Auto (value 0) so accuracy behavior doesn’t change.

SpaceMapperStepProcessingPage.xaml (Index Granularity stack panel is now Visibility="Collapsed")
If you want it completely removed later (not just hidden), I can strip the references and settings flow too.

is 0 recommended? or should it be higher?


0 is the recommended default. It uses the auto cell size (max(1000, extent/128)) with a 1.0 multiplier, which is the same multiplier as “Normal” (2). Higher (coarse = 1) makes bigger cells (faster build, more candidates), lower (fine/ultra = 3/4) makes smaller cells (slower build, fewer candidates). No accuracy impact either way.

Reference: SpatialGridSizing.cs.

explain that to me as i dont underdtand - will ultra fine on my high performance pc make it faster to process?


Short answer: ultra fine does not automatically make it faster, even on a high‑performance PC.

Think of it like a grid used to narrow down “which targets might be near this zone.”

Ultra fine = very small cells → many more cells to build and manage (more memory, more upfront work).
Benefit = fewer candidates to test per zone.
So it’s a trade‑off. If your model has huge numbers of overlapping zones/targets (candidate explosion), finer can help. If not, the extra grid work usually makes it slower.
Auto/Normal (value 0/2) is generally the best default. It uses max(1000, extent/128) as the base cell size, which is already a balanced pick.

If you want to experiment anyway, we can expose it behind an “advanced” toggle and you can try one run each to compare.

You said before " It does not change containment accuracy" so if it doesnt imrpove speed or accuracy then whats the point


Good pushback. The point is performance tuning for extreme cases, not accuracy. It can improve speed, but only when the model’s zone/target distribution makes the default grid size a bad fit. Otherwise it’s neutral or worse.

Example:

Lots of tiny targets scattered in a huge model → finer grid can reduce candidate pairs and speed up processing.
Few large zones or clustered targets → finer grid just adds overhead and slows down.
Coarser grid reduces index build cost and memory, but can increase candidate checks.
So the knob exists for edge cases; for most users, Auto is best. That’s why hiding it makes sense. If you ever hit a pathological slow case, we can temporarily expose it to test.

ok and what about fast traversal what does that do - should we set a default?


Fast Traversal is just the iteration strategy for the intersection loop — it doesn’t change accuracy.

Zone‑major: iterate zones → find candidate targets (good when zones are fewer or when partials/bounds modes are in play).
Target‑major: iterate targets → find candidate zones (only valid when Target Bounds = Midpoint and partials are off; it uses point indexing).
Auto picks between them based on preflight counts (if targets ≫ zones, it prefers target‑major). Without a preflight snapshot it resolves to zone‑major.

Recommendation: keep Auto as the default (it’s safest, and it already falls back to zone‑major when target‑major isn’t valid). If you want a fixed default, choose Zone‑major. Target‑major should only be forced when you’re on Midpoint with partials disabled and you have far more targets than zones.

have it as auto but just make it not viewable you should know mroe than the user what it should be


Hid the Fast Traversal controls while keeping the setting at Auto so it still drives the engine without being user-visible. I wrapped the Fast Traversal row + hint/resolved text in a collapsed container inside SpaceMapperStepProcessingPage.xaml, leaving the rest of Advanced Performance visible.

Tests not run (not requested).

remove max threads and bach size (remove Advanced Performance) again these can be default


Advanced Performance (including Max Threads and Batch Size) is now hidden so defaults apply.

SpaceMapperStepProcessingPage.xaml (expander set to Visibility="Collapsed")
If you want me to also remove the template/settings wiring for those fields, say the word.

writeback strategy can i just always use optimised?


Short answer: yes — optimized is safe to use all the time for real writeback.

It doesn’t change the values written; it just batches COM writes per category using PropertyWriterSession, so it’s faster and reduces UI churn. The only reasons to use:

Legacy: if you ever hit a model where optimized writeback fails (rare compatibility fallback).
Virtual (no bake): if you want to run without writing any properties.
It’s already the default (OptimizedSingleCategory). If you want, I can hide the Writeback Strategy dropdown and hard‑lock it to optimized (but that removes “Virtual” and “Legacy” as options).

good we can remove this also as it can be defaulted to optimised which it already is as u say


Done. The Writeback Strategy selector is now hidden while staying defaulted to Optimized in code.

SpaceMapperStepProcessingPage.xaml (writeback strategy row is Visibility="Collapsed")
If you want it fully removed from settings/templating, I can strip those references too.

yes


Writeback strategy is now fully removed from the UI and settings flow. It’s always forced to optimized, and templates no longer apply any alternative value.

Changes:

Removed the writeback strategy row from SpaceMapperStepProcessingPage.xaml.
Forced WritebackStrategy = SpaceMapperWritebackStrategy.OptimizedSingleCategory in SpaceMapperControl.xaml.cs.
Removed the unused selection method and ApplySettings mapping.
Dropped the page property for the combo in SpaceMapperStepProcessingPage.xaml.cs.
Tests not run (not requested).

do the same with other things we've hidden but of course make sure its all working as appropriate defaults with fallbacks


Removed the preflight/benchmark wiring from Space Mapper processing so hidden advanced options default internally and no longer reference missing UI controls. In SpaceMapperControl.xaml.cs I set the advanced tuning defaults (MaxThreads/BatchSize null, IndexGranularity 0, FastTraversal Auto), removed the preflight/benchmark flows and their validation/summary bits, and kept the existing change hooks as no-ops to avoid rewiring event handlers.

Tests not run (not requested).

If you want a quick verification, run dotnet build /p:DeployToProgramData=false.

writeback section is blank


Moved the writeback performance options into the Writeback Output card and removed the now-empty Performance & Optimization card so the writeback section is populated again. This is all in SpaceMapperStepProcessingPage.xaml.

Tests not run (not requested). If you want, I can tweak the ordering or wording in that card.

what does show internal properties during writeback do?


It controls whether the writeback uses a GUI property node with “show internal properties” enabled. In SpaceMapperService.cs, PropertyWriterSession calls GetGUIPropertyNode(path, showInternalProperties). When on, Navisworks exposes hidden/internal categories during the run (useful if you need to write to or inspect internal categories); when off, it uses the normal view and only falls back to internal if a write fails. It doesn’t change mapping logic—just which property node the COM writeback uses, and it can add overhead if the Properties pane is open.

give me an example of what it would look like with it on or off


Here’s a concrete, UI‑style example of what you’d see in the Properties pane or property picker; exact names vary by model source (Revit/IFC/etc.), but the idea holds.

Off (default):

User Defined
ME_SpaceInfo
Zone Name = “Level 2 – East”
Zone Behaviour = “Contained”
Item
Name = “Wall 01”
Element
Category = “Walls”
On (show internal properties):

User Defined
ME_SpaceInfo
Zone Name = “Level 2 – East”
Zone Behaviour = “Contained”
Item
Name = “Wall 01”
Element
Category = “Walls”
Internal / LcRevitPropertyCategory / (other internal categories)
lc:Id = “123456”
lc:UniqueId = “…”
(many extra ID‑style properties)
So “On” doesn’t change Space Mapper’s own output; it just exposes internal/hidden categories and raw property names to the writeback pipeline (and UI), which can be useful for special cases but adds noise and can slow things down if the Properties pane is open.

add on hover information rather than having text always shown - make sure its easy to understand


Replaced the always‑visible help text with hover tooltips and info icons in the Assignment and Writeback Output cards, so the UI stays clean but still explains each option on hover. This is all in SpaceMapperStepProcessingPage.xaml.

Notable changes:

Assignment header now has an info icon tooltip that combines the general description and the dynamic containment hint (the hint text is still updated, just hidden).
Target filtering and partial handling checkboxes now show their explanations on hover.
Writeback Output header uses a hover tooltip for its description.
Writeback performance option explanations and the “Tip/Why?” line are now tooltips on the relevant checkboxes.
Tests not run (not requested). If you want the tooltips to appear only on the info icons (instead of the checkboxes), say the word and I’ll switch them.

User attachment
on hobersare not showing anything and i want on hover for each tickbox


I set explicit tooltip behavior on each checkbox (enabled, show‑on‑disabled, short delay) so the hover text shows reliably. Updated SpaceMapperStepProcessingPage.xaml.

If tooltips still don’t appear in Navisworks, I can switch these to the hover flyouts we use elsewhere (those always show), just say the word.

User attachment
still dont see onhover for each tick box - remove the section on hover, it can be a written descriptuon but for tickboxes etc should be onhover information button for each of them just like step 4 mapping builder. Also keep the onhover popup timing the same as section 4 it works well and is responsive i dont like a delay like you currently have it. step 4 on hovers work perfectally


Swapped the checkbox tooltips for hover info buttons (same hover flyout behavior as Step 4), and restored the Assignment/Writeback descriptions as static text instead of section‑level hover. Each checkbox now has its own info icon + flyout with the explanation, so the hover timing matches the Mapping Builder behavior.

Files touched:

SpaceMapperStepProcessingPage.xaml
SpaceMapperStepProcessingPage.xaml.cs
Tests not run (not requested). If you want, I can add the same hover info buttons to any other checkboxes on this page.

User attachment
lets merge these two sections into one and make it apporpriately titled etc


Merged Assignment + Writeback into a single card titled “Assignment & Writeback,” with clear subheadings and the existing info buttons kept per checkbox. Updated SpaceMapperStepProcessingPage.xaml.

If you want the “Assignment” subheading removed (since the card title already includes it), say the word.

arrange it so zone offsets is after containment accuracy


Moved the Zone Offsets card so it now follows Containment Accuracy and comes before Assignment & Writeback. This change is in SpaceMapperStepProcessingPage.xaml.

Tests not run (not requested).

User attachment
remove where it says Writebakc performance as we already have a title and description for this section


Removed the “Writeback performance” subheading from the Assignment & Writeback card. Updated SpaceMapperStepProcessingPage.xaml.

Tests not run (not requested).

give me an overview of the recent ui changes we've done, why we have done them for step 3


Here’s a concise overview of the Step 3 UI changes and the intent behind them:

Re‑structured the page into clearer, task‑focused cards and sequencing: Containment Accuracy → Zone Offsets → Assignment & Writeback. This follows the actual workflow (how we evaluate intersections, then apply offsets, then decide matching/writeback behavior).
Removed preflight/benchmark UI and advanced performance controls (max threads, batch size, index granularity, fast traversal, writeback strategy). Those are now defaults under the hood to keep the UI simpler and reduce confusion.
Consolidated “Assignment” and “Writeback Output” into a single card (“Assignment & Writeback”) to keep all matching + output behavior in one place.
Moved the writeback performance options (skip unchanged, pack outputs, show internal, close panes) into the Writeback section so they’re still accessible without a separate performance card.
Replaced always‑visible helper text under checkboxes with per‑option info buttons that use the same hover flyout behavior as Step 4 (Mapping Builder). This keeps the UI clean but still provides guidance on demand.
Trimmed redundant headings (removed “Writeback performance” subheading) since the section title and description already frame the intent.
Net effect: Step 3 is cleaner, more focused, and easier to follow, while still exposing the critical toggles users need.

implement instructions from ReferenceDocuments\Space_Mapper-UpdatedAdditions_13.txt


Wired the new Write Zone Behaviour checkbox end‑to‑end so it actually controls partial detection and writeback, and updated comparison reporting to reflect it.

SpaceMapperModels.cs adds WriteZoneBehaviorProperty to processing settings for serialization.
SpaceMapperControl.xaml.cs now reads/writes the new checkbox (with Tag Partial fallback for old templates), validates zone behavior fields off that checkbox, and hooks its change events.
SpaceMapperService.cs, SpaceMapperEngines.cs, and SpaceMapperPreflightService.cs use WriteZoneBehaviorProperty for writeback entries, partial computation, and signatures.
SpaceMapperComparisonRunner.cs clones/reports the new setting, includes it in needs‑partial logic, and surfaces it in markdown output.
I didn’t run a build.

Next steps (pick one):

Run dotnet build /p:DeployToProgramData=false.
Validate in the UI that toggling “Write Zone Behaviour property” enables the fields and writes the status even when Tag Partial is off.
implement instructions from ReferenceDocuments\Space_Mapper-UpdatedAdditions_14.txt


Added a separate-thread progress window for Space Mapper runs and wired coarse progress/cancellation through the engine and service so the UI stays responsive while the synchronous run executes.

New progress state + window + STA host in SpaceMapperRunProgressState.cs, SpaceMapperRunProgressWindow.xaml, SpaceMapperRunProgressWindow.xaml.cs, and SpaceMapperRunProgressHost.cs to show a WPF-UI ProgressRing and poll state.
Engine/service now accept a SpaceMapperRunProgressState and update stages/counters (zones/targets/writeback) without per-candidate UI updates in SpaceMapperEngines.cs and SpaceMapperService.cs.
RunSpaceMapper now opens the progress window, supports cancel, and closes the popup before navigating to Results in SpaceMapperControl.xaml.cs.
Not run (build/test not requested).

Next steps:

dotnet build /p:DeployToProgramData=false
Run Space Mapper and verify the progress window updates + Cancel stops the run and leaves you on Step 3.

look at my settings, and objects in the model - a top view of the zone (blue) and door (gray). You can see the door should not inherit the name of the zone as the midpoint sits outside it - why is this getting the zone name?


It’s getting the zone name because the midpoint test is still using the zone’s AABB, not the visible zone shape. With your settings, Target Bounds = Midpoint and Zone Representation = AABB, so the midpoint is classified via ZoneContainsPoint using the AABB check only; the door’s midpoint falls inside that bounding box even though it’s outside the concave zone outline. This is the exact path in SpaceMapperEngines.cs (line 816) and SpaceMapperEngines.cs (line 952).

Mesh‑accurate doesn’t change that right now because we don’t actually extract zone triangles yet—GeometryExtractor.ExtractVertices is a stub, so planes are just the bounding box planes (SpaceMapperGeometry.cs (line 88)). That means “mesh accurate” still falls back to bounds for point‑in‑zone checks.

If you want this fixed, I can:

Make mesh‑accurate point tests always prefer planes when available (fallback to bounds only if planes are missing), and
Implement triangle extraction so those planes represent the real zone shape.
Tell me which path you want and I’ll implement it.

User attachment
for the zone ive chosen mesh accurate and hull so for zones that should be the most accurate. midpoint is only for the object


You’re right: mesh‑accurate + hull should be the most accurate for zones. The reason it still tags that door is that we never build a real hull or mesh planes for zones right now. GeometryExtractor.ExtractVertices is a stub, so GeometryMath.BuildPlanes falls back to axis‑aligned bbox planes, which makes the point test equivalent to AABB even when “Hull” is selected. That’s why the midpoint (outside the visible zone) still passes—it's inside the zone’s bounding box.

Key spots:

SpaceMapperGeometry.cs (line 88) (no triangle extraction → planes are bbox)
SpaceMapperEngines.cs (line 952) (point‑in‑zone uses planes if available; otherwise AABB)
If you want this to behave like you expect, I can:

Implement real mesh/triangle extraction (Navisworks COM API on the main thread) and build proper planes/hull; or
Hide/disable hull/obb/k‑dop until real geometry is available, so the UI doesn’t imply accuracy we can’t deliver yet.
Which path do you want me to take?

In regards to this - Follow instructions from ReferenceDocuments\Space_Mapper-UpdatedAdditions_15.txt


Mesh-accurate now actually uses the zone triangle mesh for point containment (with a bounds fallback), so the “midpoint outside zone” case should stop getting tagged when a mesh is available. I wired mesh extraction via COM fragments, added a ray-cast point‑in‑mesh test, and threaded the containment engine through the point classification path so the UI setting matches backend behavior.

Details and where:

SpaceMapperGeometry.cs: COM triangle extraction with local→world transform, cached triangle fields, and GeometryMath.TryIsInsideMesh (ray/triangle + boundary check).
SpaceMapperModels.cs: added TriangleVertices, TriangleCount, HasTriangleMesh to ZoneGeometry.
SpaceMapperEngines.cs: ZoneContainsPoint now honors MeshAccurate and uses the mesh test when available; all call sites pass containmentEngine.
Build note: dotnet build completed compilation but timed out during deploy because Navisworks has MicroEng.Navisworks.dll locked in MicroEng.Navisworks.

If you want, I can also add the optional diagnostics/mesh-volume tie‑breaker from the doc. Otherwise, a good next check is to close Navisworks or build with /p:DeployToProgramData=false, then re-run the door/zone case to confirm the midpoint stays untagged.

when i hit run export a report that documents everything - search sets used - information on every step - tickboxes and settings - the ouputs etc - put it in a known location that you can find so i can get you to review


when i hit Run Space Mapper, export a report that documents everything - search sets used - information on every step - tickboxes and settings - the ouputs etc - put it in a known location that you can find so i can get you to review


when i hit Run Space Mapper, on completion of the run, export a report that documents everything - search sets used - information on every step - tickboxes and settings - the ouputs - completion results etc - put it in a known location that you can find so i can get you to review


Added a run-completion report writer that captures setup, zones/targets, processing settings, mappings, and results, then saves it to a known ProgramData Reports folder and surfaces the path in the results summary so you can grab it quickly.

Details:

Report generation + pathing live in SpaceMapperRunReportWriter.cs and are invoked after a successful run from SpaceMapperService.cs.
The saved report path is appended to the results summary in SpaceMapperControl.xaml.cs, and the path is also logged.
Reports save to C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\Navisworks Manage 2025\Plugins\MicroEng.Navisworks\Reports\SpaceMapper\ with filenames like SpaceMapper_Run_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_<Model>_<Template>.md.
I didn’t run a build because Navisworks can lock the plugin DLL during deploy.

If you want, next steps:

Run Space Mapper once and check the “Report:” line in the results summary for the exact file path.
If you want a JSON companion report or more/less detail, tell me what to add/remove.
review the last two reports. tried different settings but nothing is showing up in a room


Findings

High: Both runs produced zero intersections and zero writeback, so nothing can appear in rooms regardless of mapping. This is explicit in Step 5 of SpaceMapper_Run_20260103_005001_CRRTSD-250-0130-MOD-HASS-1400-510000.nwf_Doors.md and SpaceMapper_Run_20260103_005021_CRRTSD-250-0130-MOD-HASS-1400-510000.nwf_Doors.md.
High: The mesh‑accurate run uses Midpoint targets with partials disabled (Treat partial as contained: False, Tag partial separately: False). That means only targets whose midpoint is strictly inside a zone will ever be tagged. If door centers sit on or outside the room boundary (common), you will get zero hits. See Step 3 in SpaceMapper_Run_20260103_005001_CRRTSD-250-0130-MOD-HASS-1400-510000.nwf_Doors.md.
Medium: The bounds‑fast run still has partials disabled, so any door that only intersects a room (not fully contained) gets dropped before writeback. The rule membership says ContainedAndPartial, but partials are not computed unless those toggles are on. See Step 3 in SpaceMapper_Run_20260103_005021_CRRTSD-250-0130-MOD-HASS-1400-510000.nwf_Doors.md.
Medium: The “Hull” selection in the bounds‑fast run does not materially change containment right now because triangle extraction only happens for MeshAccurate; bounds modes are still effectively AABB. That means the settings change between the two runs did not actually loosen containment in the way the UI implies. This is in SpaceMapperGeometry.cs.
Questions / assumptions

Are your room zones true volumes or 2D surfaces? If they’re thin surfaces, door midpoints (Z) will usually be outside unless you use bottom‑center or offsets.
Do you want doors that intersect a room to count? If yes, you’ll need partial handling on, or a different target representation (AABB) instead of Midpoint.
Change summary

No code changes in this review.
Suggested next steps

Enable “Treat Partial as Contained” (or “Tag Partial Separately”) for doors to allow boundary intersections to resolve into a room.
If you want to stay with Midpoint, switch midpoint mode to bottom‑center and add a small positive top offset on zones.
If you want Hull/K‑DOP/OBB to truly affect bounds‑fast runs, I can extend extraction so those modes are backed by actual geometry.
cehck the last 2 which ive done for furniture - they are definitly in rooms


Findings

High: Your latest furniture run at SpaceMapper_Run_20260103_005829_CRRTSD-250-0130-MOD-HASS-1400-510000.nwf_Furniture.md produced zero intersections and zero writes, so nothing can show up in rooms. That run used Zone bounds: Hull and Target bounds: Hull with partials off.
Medium: The earlier furniture run at SpaceMapper_Run_20260103_005555_CRRTSD-250-0130-MOD-HASS-1400-510000.nwf_Furniture.md did tag 15 contained targets and wrote 7 properties, so the workflow can work with these targets.
Medium: The “Hull” bounds setting isn’t backed by real hull math yet for bounds‑fast mode, so switching to Hull does not increase containment accuracy; it can actually reduce hits depending on how candidates are filtered. In your zero‑hit run, that seems to have happened.
What likely happened

Switching to Hull/Hull with partials off caused candidate filtering + containment to return zero hits, even though the furniture is visually inside rooms. The AABB run shows the data is valid and the mappings are functional.
Recommended next run

Set Zone bounds = AABB and Target bounds = AABB (the exact settings from the 00:55:55 run).
If you want Hull later, enable partial handling so borderline furniture still resolves.
If you want me to enforce a safe fallback (e.g., auto‑use AABB when Hull/OBB/K‑DOP aren’t supported), I can wire that in.

Follow instructions from ReferenceDocuments\Space_Mapper-UpdatedAdditions_16.txt


Mesh‑accurate now has a clean fallback path, avoids invalid plane sets, and reports real mesh usage/fallback in the run report. I also added UI‑thread marshaling for COM extraction and cache separation by geometry mode so switching modes doesn’t reuse bbox‑only geometry.

Details and where:

Safe plane fallback and separation of mesh vs bounds: SpaceMapperGeometry.cs now uses AABB planes for bounds modes, keeps triangle meshes separate, and only treats vertex lists as triangles when they’re valid.
UI‑thread COM extraction + cache mode isolation + per‑zone mesh failure logging: SpaceMapperGeometry.cs plus dispatcher hookup in SpaceMapperControl.xaml.cs.
Mesh/bounds point‑test counters and mesh fallback tracking wired through the engine: SpaceMapperEngines.cs and SpaceMapperModels.cs.
Run report now includes mesh diagnostics (zones with mesh, fallback counts, mesh/bounds point tests, extraction errors): SpaceMapperRunReportWriter.cs, with stats plumbed through SpaceMapperService.cs.
I didn’t run a build because Navisworks can lock the deployed DLL.

If you want to validate quickly:

Run Space Mapper once with Mesh Accurate on, then check the report for “Zones with mesh” and “Mesh point tests” in the new diagnostics block.
If those stay at 0, the report will now also show “Zones mesh fallback” and “Mesh extraction errors” so we can pinpoint why.

Fixed the build error by avoiding out parameters inside the Dispatcher lambda.

Change is in SpaceMapperGeometry.cs where the UI‑thread invoke now uses a local variable and assigns failed after the invoke.

You can re-run dotnet clean; dotnet build. If Navisworks is still open and locking the DLL, use /p:DeployToProgramData=false or close Navisworks for the deploy step.

In your report do you give a reason why a fallback was used?


Not yet. The report shows counts (zones with mesh, mesh fallback, extraction errors) but it doesn’t include per‑zone reasons. The only “reason” captured today is in the log when mesh extraction fails.

If you want, I can add a section to the report that lists:

Zones that fell back because no triangles were extracted, and
Zones that fell back due to extraction errors (with the error message).
make sure its in the .md outputs that you review so you know whats happening in the model e.g. if ther zones are bot enclosed or some other issue that it had to fall back


Added explicit fallback reasons into the run report, including a “MeshNotClosed” classification with boundary/non‑manifold edge counts, plus extraction failure details. The report now has a “Mesh Fallback Reasons” section that lists summaries and per‑zone details so you can see why a mesh fell back.

Where it’s implemented:

Mesh extraction status, closure validation, and fallback reason capture: SpaceMapperGeometry.cs
Report output of reasons/details: SpaceMapperRunReportWriter.cs
New zone fields for reporting: SpaceMapperModels.cs
Test run:

dotnet build /p:DeployToProgramData=false
Next time you run Space Mapper with Mesh Accurate, check the report’s “Mesh Fallback Reasons” section for entries like:

ExtractionFailed with the error message
NoTriangles
InvalidTriangleList
MeshNotClosed with edge counts
now does it get to the first mesh that doesnt work then fall backl for the rest of the xones or does it try mesh accurate for all zones indiddually before falling back for each zone


It’s per‑zone. Each zone gets its own mesh extraction and closure check, and only that zone falls back if it fails. There’s no global “first failure then fall back for all zones” behavior.

check the latest output and see what u can find


Here’s what stands out in the latest report:

Mesh accurate is running and triangle extraction succeeded for most zones: Zones with mesh: 135.
10 zones fell back because the meshes are not closed (MeshNotClosed). The report lists them with boundary edge counts, e.g. EMERGENCY EGRESS 2 250.05.206 has BoundaryEdges=34.
No bounds fallback was used for point tests (Bounds point tests: 0, Mesh fallback point tests: 0). That means every point test used mesh, not bounds.
Still zero intersections and zero tags despite 21 furniture targets. With midpoint mode + mesh accurate, this means none of the furniture midpoints are inside the room meshes.
So the system is working as designed; the reason for “nothing in rooms” is that the midpoint is outside all zone meshes. If you want hits, you’ll need to switch to AABB target bounds or enable partial handling, or adjust the midpoint mode/zone offsets so midpoints land inside rooms.

when i choose mesh accurate for the zone i cannot change the target representation. also why does ity say for testing?


It locks because Mesh Accurate currently only supports point‑in‑mesh containment, so targets must be Midpoint. The code forces the slider to 0 and disables it in SpaceMapperControl.xaml.cs, and BuildSettings() also hard‑sets Midpoint when mesh accurate is selected. If we let you pick AABB/OBB/K‑DOP here, it would silently drop back to bounds logic (not mesh), which would be misleading.

The “for testing” text is just leftover wording in the UI label (SpaceMapperStepProcessingPage.xaml). I can remove it or replace it with something clearer like “Target Representation” or “Target Bounds (for containment)”, and optionally add a note that mesh‑accurate forces Midpoint.

remvoe for testing


Removed “for testing” from the label in SpaceMapperStepProcessingPage.xaml.

"It locks because Mesh Accurate currently only supports point‑in‑mesh containment, so targets must be Midpoint. The code forces the slider to 0 and disables it in SpaceMapperControl.xaml.cs, and BuildSettings() also hard‑sets Midpoint when mesh accurate is selected. If we let you pick AABB/OBB/K‑DOP here, it would silently drop back to bounds logic (not mesh), which would be misleading."

Why can we not use Mesh Bound for zones with convex for targets?


Right now mesh‑accurate is wired only to point‑in‑mesh (one point per target), so it requires Midpoint. The non‑midpoint paths use plane/bounds logic (ClassifyByPlanes/AABB) and never call the mesh test. If we let you pick AABB/OBB/k‑DOP, it would silently drop back to bounds math, which would not be mesh‑accurate.

We could support “mesh zones + convex target bounds” by sampling multiple points (8 corners + center, etc.) against the mesh and classifying contained/partial. That’s not implemented yet and would be slower, plus it still uses the target’s bounds (not the actual target mesh), so accuracy is mixed.

If you want that behavior, I can add it and re‑enable the target slider for mesh‑accurate mode.

All the information is already in the navisworks model on the objects in your export also report the targets Transform properties as you can see in the image and your calculated midpoint to see if they line up


Added a report section that captures each target’s Transform properties from the model (Scale/Rotation/Translation/Reverses) alongside the computed midpoint so you can compare them directly, and kept it scoped to a manageable number of targets to avoid huge reports. This is in SpaceMapperRunReportWriter.cs.

Report location remains C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\Navisworks Manage 2025\Plugins\MicroEng.Navisworks\Reports\SpaceMapper.

If you want, I can:

run a quick build to confirm, or
run Space Mapper and inspect the latest report content with you.

Checked the two latest reports in C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\Navisworks Manage 2025\Plugins\MicroEng.Navisworks\Reports\SpaceMapper. Key findings:

SpaceMapper_Run_20260103_024440_CRRTSD-250-0130-MOD-HASS-1400-510000.nwf_Furniture.md: 145 zones, 21 targets, 0 intersections, 0 contained/partial, 0 writes; candidate pairs 35; Use origin point only True; MeshAccurate + Hull fallback; 10 zones fell back due to MeshNotClosed (boundary edges).
SpaceMapper_Run_20260103_021449_CRRTSD-250-0130-MOD-HASS-1400-510000.nwf_Furniture.md: same results (0 intersections, 10 mesh fallback).
In the latest report’s “Target Transforms & Midpoints” section, every target shows Transform: <missing>, so the transform properties aren’t being captured yet (likely category name mismatch vs “Transform (LCO, Node)”).
If you want, I can:

fix transform capture to match “Transform*” categories or use ModelItem.Transform and regenerate the report, or
dig into why midpoints aren’t intersecting zones (likely coordinate/transform vs mesh space mismatch) and add diagnostic ranges in the report.

heres another view with internal porperties turned on in developer settings


I’ve updated the report reader to normalize category/property names by stripping the internal suffixes like “(LCoaTransform)”, so it should now match what you see in the internal properties view and populate Transform values instead of <missing>. This change is in SpaceMapperRunReportWriter.cs.

Next step: rerun Space Mapper once so it regenerates a report with the Transform values filled. If you want me to build or inspect the new report afterward, say the word.

ok check now just the last one


Latest report SpaceMapper_Run_20260103_025704_CRRTSD-250-0130-MOD-HASS-1400-510000.nwf_Furniture.md still shows Transform: <missing> for all targets, so the previous normalization didn’t take.

I’ve now updated the report reader to normalize category/property keys (strip internal suffixes and punctuation) and fall back to searching all categories, which should pick up Transform (LCoaTransform) and Scale.X (LCoaTransformScale0) style names. This change is in SpaceMapperRunReportWriter.cs.

Rerun Space Mapper once to regenerate the report, and I’ll check the latest file again. If it’s still missing, I can add a temporary category/property dump for the first target to see exactly what the API exposes.

ok check


Latest report SpaceMapper_Run_20260103_030406_CRRTSD-250-0130-MOD-HASS-1400-510000.nwf_Furniture.md still shows Transform: <missing> for all targets.

I’ve updated the matching logic to also recognize internal property names like LCoaTransformScale0/1/2 and LCoaTransformRotationAxis0/1/2, so it should now resolve the Transform values. Change is in SpaceMapperRunReportWriter.cs.

Rerun Space Mapper once to regenerate the report, and I’ll re-check the newest file. If it still shows missing, I’ll add a one-time property dump for the first target so we can see exactly what the API is returning.

Ok lets change our approach follow instructions from ReferenceDocuments\Space_Mapper-UpdatedAdditions_16.txt - and use 2) The “correct” way to export “known transform” for comparison


Switched the report to use COM fragment local‑to‑world matrices as the “known transform,” and expanded the target section to show world‑space bounds plus the exact point the engine used. This matches the “correct” export path you referenced.

Details

SpaceMapperRunReportWriter.cs now writes BBox min/max/center and “Point used” for each target, and pulls fragment transforms via GetLocalToWorldMatrix() with fragment count + sample matrices/translations.
Internal property reads are now optional (“Show internal properties during writeback”), and a one‑time property‑key dump is emitted only if fragment transforms are unavailable.
Next steps

Run Space Mapper once to generate a fresh report and send the latest SpaceMapper_Run_*.md path so I can confirm the fragment transforms are now populated.
If you want the internal property block included, enable “Show internal properties during writeback” before the run.
ok go check


Checked the newest report SpaceMapper_Run_20260103_035550_CRRTSD-250-0130-MOD-HASS-1400-510000.nwf_Furniture.md.

What changed (good):

The “Target Transforms & Midpoints” section now shows BBox min/max/center, Point used, and Fragment matrices with fragment counts. So the COM fragment transform export is working.
Example: FRN_Seat_Island_Square_Advertising now shows a fragment matrix and translation, instead of <missing>.
Key observation:

The fragment matrices show translation in the last row (e.g., [624.168, 6.96, -31.931, 1]), while the translation column in the matrix is currently 0,0,0. That means we’re reading Navisworks’ matrix in a row-major vs column-major arrangement (or using the wrong indices for translation). So the “Fragment Translation” line in the report is currently wrong (it’s still (0,0,0) for all fragments).
If you want, I’ll fix the translation extraction to read the correct indices (Navisworks uses a different matrix layout), then regenerate and re-check the report.

ok go ahead


Updated the report’s fragment translation extraction so it pulls the correct translation from the COM matrix (row‑4 vs col‑4), labels the source, and avoids misaligned translation samples. This should fix the Translation: (0,0,0) issue and make the fragment translation match the matrix/bounds you’re comparing against. Changes are in SpaceMapperRunReportWriter.cs.

Next steps:

Run Space Mapper once to generate a new report.
Tell me the latest SpaceMapper_Run_*.md path and I’ll verify the translation lines now match the fragment matrices.
ok review last 2 exports


Reviewed the last two exports:

Latest run: SpaceMapper_Run_20260103_040626_CRRTSD-250-0130-MOD-HASS-1400-510000.nwf_Furniture.md

MeshAccurate + Midpoint + UseOriginPointOnly True
0 contained / 0 partial / 0 intersections
Mesh diagnostics: 135 zones with mesh, 10 fallback (MeshNotClosed), 35 mesh point tests
Fragment translations are now coming through and align with the matrices (row‑4), e.g. Fragment[0] Translation (row4): (624.168, 6.96, -31.931).
Previous run: SpaceMapper_Run_20260103_040559_CRRTSD-250-0130-MOD-HASS-1400-510000.nwf_Furniture.md

BoundsFast + AABB target bounds, UseOriginPointOnly False
21 contained / 14 partial / 35 intersections
Mesh diagnostics all zero (as expected in BoundsFast mode).
Key difference: the BoundsFast run produces tags, while the MeshAccurate + Midpoint run produces none, even though candidate pairs are still 35. That points to the mesh point‑in‑mesh test rejecting all midpoint samples (or the mesh is invalid/concave from the point test’s perspective), not a selection/target issue.

If you want, I can:

add a report line that shows how many midpoints pass AABB but fail mesh for each zone, or
add a debug toggle to also test bounds in parallel for mesh runs to see where the drop‑off happens.
did you compare our computed midpoint against Navisworks’ known transform/origin information


Not yet. The reports now include both values side‑by‑side (BBox center / point used and fragment translation matrices), but I haven’t added an explicit comparison or delta calculation.

If you want, I can add a “midpoint vs fragment translation” delta in the report (per target, and a summary of max/avg).

do it


Added the midpoint vs fragment‑transform comparison in the report: each printed fragment now includes a “Delta to point used (point ‑ fragment)” line with distance, so you can see how far the computed point is from the COM transform translation. This is in SpaceMapperRunReportWriter.cs.

Next steps:

Run Space Mapper once to generate a new SpaceMapper_Run_*.md report.
Share the latest report path and I’ll review the deltas.
ok review the last export


Reviewed the latest export SpaceMapper_Run_20260103_041643_CRRTSD-250-0130-MOD-HASS-1400-510000.nwf_Furniture.md.

Key takeaways:

Midpoint vs fragment translation comparison is now present. Many targets show delta = (0,0,0), meaning the computed point matches the fragment translation exactly.
Some targets show consistent non‑zero deltas, e.g. around (±1.55, 0, 1.519) with distance ~2.17, or (0, ±0.535, 1.427) distance ~1.524. These look like a systematic offset between bounds‑center and fragment translation (likely fragment origin not at bounds center).
Despite matching points for many items, the run still yields 0 intersections under MeshAccurate + Midpoint.
So: the midpoint comparison is working and reveals that the issue isn’t universal midpoint mismatch. The next likely culprit is the mesh point‑in‑mesh test rejecting those points even when they align with the fragment translation (or mesh fallback/closure is invalid for relevant zones).

If you want, I can add a report summary that counts how many targets have delta ≈0 vs >0 and correlate those with intersection outcomes to pinpoint why mesh containment rejects everything.

yes go ahead


I don’t see any SpaceMapper_Run_*.md files to review right now — the reports folder C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\Navisworks Manage 2025\Plugins\MicroEng.Navisworks\Reports\SpaceMapper is empty on my side.

Reviewed latest report SpaceMapper_Run_20260103_043023_CRRTSD-250-0130-MOD-HASS-1400-510000.nwf_Furniture.md.

Transform comparison summary (new):

Targets processed: 21
Targets with point used: 21
Targets with fragment translations (sampled): 21
Point matches fragment (<= 0.001): 12
Point differs from fragment: 9
Targets with multiple distinct fragment translations: 9
Min distance avg: 0.776, max: 2.17
Interpretation:

For 12 targets, the computed midpoint aligns exactly with fragment translation.
9 targets have a consistent offset (typically ~1.5–2.2 units), which lines up with the “multiple distinct fragment translations” count. That suggests those items are multi‑fragment or their fragment origin doesn’t align with the bounds center.
Still unchanged:

MeshAccurate + Midpoint run produces 0 intersections/contained/partial.
Candidate pairs still 35, so the broad phase is fine; the mesh narrow‑phase is rejecting everything.
If you want, I can now add a breakdown that correlates “point matches fragment” vs “point differs” with actual intersections (right now there are none, but it will be useful once you get any hits).

yes go ahead


Findings

High: The run produced 0 intersections/contained/partial and 0 writes, so nothing was tagged despite 21 targets and 145 zones. SpaceMapper_Run_20260103_043023_CRRTSD-250-0130-MOD-HASS-1400-510000.nwf_Furniture.md
Medium: The “point used” vs fragment translation mismatches are significant for 9/21 targets (avg delta 0.776, max 2.17), and 9 targets have multiple distinct fragment translations; with origin‑point‑only (bbox center) this can push points outside rooms. SpaceMapper_Run_20260103_043023_CRRTSD-250-0130-MOD-HASS-1400-510000.nwf_Furniture.md
Medium: 10 zones fell back due to MeshNotClosed, so those zones are using bounds fallback instead of mesh accurate. SpaceMapper_Run_20260103_043023_CRRTSD-250-0130-MOD-HASS-1400-510000.nwf_Furniture.md

I checked the latest run report at SpaceMapper_Run_20260103_043023_CRRTSD-250-0130-MOD-HASS-1400-510000.nwf_Furniture.md. The three target GUIDs you listed are present and their “Point used” matches the Navisworks fragment translation (delta 0), so the midpoint/origin point isn’t off:

7a537e36-d679-4e2b-a88d-c72d91c8bedc: point (275.733, -7.513, -13.555), delta 0

That same report shows 0 intersections overall, with 35 mesh point tests and 0 bounds point tests, which means every candidate mesh test returned “outside.” The room GUID 19779cfa-136b-460f-befe-ca4b701ddb1f doesn’t appear in the report because we don’t list zones, so I can’t confirm whether that room was in the zone set or what its bounds/mesh looked like.

If you want, I can add a spot‑check section in the report for that room GUID + those three target GUIDs that logs the room bbox, mesh closure status, and the results of inside‑mesh vs inside‑bounds tests for those target points.

changed ssttings compare to the new one


I compared the two reports I can see: the earlier run SpaceMapper_Run_20260103_043023_CRRTSD-250-0130-MOD-HASS-1400-510000.nwf_Furniture.md vs the newest SpaceMapper_Run_20260103_050132_CRRTSD-250-0130-MOD-HASS-1400-510000.nwf_Furniture.md.

Key settings changes:

Zone containment engine: MeshAccurate → BoundsFast.
Target bounds: Midpoint → Hull (no point‑only check).
Use origin point only: True → False.
Mesh extraction: Zones with mesh 135 / fallback 10 / mesh point tests 35 → all 0 (mesh not used).
Result differences that follow from that:

Old run: 0 intersections, 0 contained/partial, 0 writes.
New run: 35 intersections, 21 contained, 14 partial, 42 writes.
Your room TRAIN SECURITY STAFF ROOM/ POLICE HOLDING ROOM 250.07.001 now shows contained=3, partial=0 in the zone summary (matches the 3 furniture items).
Also, the new report’s “Target Transforms & Midpoints” section no longer prints “Point used”/delta lines because you’re not in midpoint mode anymore, so the transform comparison summary shows Targets with point used: 0 (expected with Hull).

If you want me to compare against a different “old” report (e.g., the 025704 file), point me to its exact path or re‑run so it exists on disk.

Ok so clearly we have a problem here with mesh accurate not working


I found a likely root cause for Mesh Accurate failing: the mesh vertices were being transformed assuming row‑major matrices, but Navisworks fragment matrices appear to be column‑major (translation in row 4), so the mesh ends up in the wrong place and point‑in‑mesh checks return false.

I updated the vertex transform to detect layout and apply the correct formula for both 4x4 and 3x4 matrices in SpaceMapperGeometry.cs. That should put the zone mesh in the same world space as the target points.

Next steps:

Run Space Mapper again with Mesh Accurate + Midpoint.
Share the new report so I can confirm intersections show up for TRAIN SECURITY STAFF ROOM/ POLICE HOLDING ROOM 250.07.001 and the three furniture GUIDs.
new report ran


Mesh‑accurate is working now. The new run SpaceMapper_Run_20260103_052019_CRRTSD-250-0130-MOD-HASS-1400-510000.nwf_Furniture.md shows:

Mesh Accurate + Midpoint is active.
Intersections: 24 (previously 0 with mesh accurate).
Contained tagged: 24, partial: 0, multi‑zone: 3.
Your room TRAIN SECURITY STAFF ROOM/ POLICE HOLDING ROOM 250.07.001 now reports contained=3, partial=0 which matches the three furniture items.
Targets with point used: 21; point matches fragment 12, differs 9 (avg delta 0.776, max 2.17) — unchanged, but mesh classification is now successful.
If you want me to validate the three specific GUIDs against the room in the report, I can add a targeted “zone/target audit” block (room bbox + inside‑mesh vs inside‑bounds for those points) and re‑run.

Follow instructions from ReferenceDocuments\Space_Mapper-UpdatedAdditions_18.txt


Enabled Tier A/B behavior for Mesh Accurate by removing the forced Midpoint path and adding mesh‑accurate multi‑sample classification when targets aren’t points, plus aligned UI, comparison, reporting, and preflight logic so target bounds are respected end‑to‑end. Key updates are in SpaceMapperControl.xaml.cs, SpaceMapperEngines.cs, SpaceMapperService.cs, SpaceMapperComparisonRunner.cs, SpaceMapperRunReportWriter.cs, and SpaceMapperPreflightService.cs.

Not run: tests/build.

Next steps (pick one):

Run Mesh Accurate + Midpoint (Tier A) and Mesh Accurate + AABB/OBB/k‑DOP/Hull (Tier B) to confirm partials and intersections behave as expected.
Run dotnet build to confirm compile.
If you want, I can add a small report section that explicitly labels Tier A vs Tier B in the run output.
yep and the small report section


Added a small Mesh Accurate tier section to the run report so it explicitly labels Tier A vs Tier B and shows the sample count per target. It appears under Step 3 whenever Mesh Accurate is selected in SpaceMapperRunReportWriter.cs.

Details:

SpaceMapperRunReportWriter.cs now prints:
### Mesh Accurate Tier
- Tier: Tier A (Midpoint: single point) or Tier B (AABB/OBB/k-DOP/Hull: multi-sample)
- Samples per target: <count>
Not run: build/tests.

Next step if you want: run Space Mapper once and I can confirm the new section in the generated report.

review of your work has been done - see notes here - implement anythnig if necissary - ReferenceDocuments\Space_Mapper-UpdatedAdditions_19.txt


Added the “Mesh Accurate Tier” report block and made it compute the effective target mode so Tier A/B and sample counts match the engine (including the UseOriginPointOnly edge case). This lives in SpaceMapperRunReportWriter.cs. I also re‑checked for any remaining MeshAccurate→Midpoint forcing and only the legacy preset mapping in ApplyLegacyBoundsFromPreset still sets Midpoint for the Fast preset (not MeshAccurate‑specific).

Not run: build/tests.

If you want to verify:

dotnet build
Run Mesh Accurate + Midpoint and Mesh Accurate + Hull; confirm the new “Mesh Accurate Tier” section appears with sample counts 1 and 27.

Reviewed the five most recent reports (by LastWriteTime). Here’s what they show:

Latest Five

SpaceMapper_Run_20260103_160912_CRRTSD-250-0130-MOD-HASS-1400-510000.nwf_Furniture.md — Tier B Hull, intersections 24, contained 12, partial 12, multi‑zone 3, writes 42, mesh fallback 11, mesh point tests 622.
SpaceMapper_Run_20260103_160803_CRRTSD-250-0130-MOD-HASS-1400-510000.nwf_Furniture.md — same settings/results as 160912 (duplicate run).
SpaceMapper_Run_20260103_160750_CRRTSD-250-0130-MOD-HASS-1400-510000.nwf_Furniture.md — Tier A Midpoint, intersections 24, contained 24, partial 0, multi‑zone 3, writes 42, mesh fallback 11, mesh point tests 32.
SpaceMapper_Run_20260103_160740_CRRTSD-250-0130-MOD-HASS-1400-510000.nwf_Furniture.md — Tier B AABB, intersections 24, contained 24, partial 12, multi‑zone 3, writes 42, mesh fallback 11, mesh point tests 223.
SpaceMapper_Run_20260103_160724_CRRTSD-250-0130-MOD-HASS-1400-510000.nwf_Furniture.md — Tier B OBB, intersections 24, contained 24, partial 12, multi‑zone 3, writes 42, mesh fallback 11, mesh point tests 244.
Findings

Tier B behaves as expected: partials appear when using AABB/OBB/Hull, while Tier A (Midpoint) has zero partials.
Hull is the strictest: contained drops to 12 with 12 partials; AABB/OBB keep contained at 24 with 12 partials.
Mesh fallback stays at 11 across all runs, so those zones still don’t have closed meshes.
Mesh point tests scale with sampling: Midpoint 32 → AABB/OBB ~200s → Hull 622 (consistent with Tier B sampling).
Two newest reports are identical; only one is needed unless you want to compare run‑to‑run timing.
If you want, I can also pull the zone summaries for a specific room/target set or run a k‑DOP Tier B variant (not present in the last five).

and a run variation check report that will run through all the zone / target variations - add the button to the top right of containemnt accuracy section. will be a good way to check if everything is going well


Added a Containment Accuracy header action that runs a full variation check across all zone/target bounds combinations using your current settings, then writes a report to the standard SpaceMapper reports folder.

SpaceMapperStepProcessingPage.xaml: inserted the top‑right “Run Variation Check” button in the Containment Accuracy card header.
SpaceMapperStepProcessingPage.xaml.cs: exposed the new button to the host.
SpaceMapperControl.xaml.cs: wired the click handler, added variation‑only validation, and report output (markdown + JSON) to SpaceMapper_VariationCheck_<timestamp>_<model>_<template>.md.
SpaceMapperComparisonRunner.cs: added an all‑bounds variant mode and uses current settings as the baseline.
Build: dotnet build compiled but timed out while deploying because Navisworks is locking MicroEng.Navisworks.dll.

Next steps:

Re‑run dotnet build after closing Navisworks, or use dotnet build /p:DeployToProgramData=false.
Click “Run Variation Check” in Step 3 and send me the newest report path for review.
Implement Update - ReferenceDocuments\Space_Mapper-UpdatedAdditions_19.txt


Consolidated the TargetBoundsMode resolution into a shared helper so engine and preflight can’t drift, and confirmed there’s no MeshAccurate→Midpoint coercion left in the path.

Added shared resolver in SpaceMapperBoundsResolver.cs with the Tier A/B logic.
Wired engine and preflight to use it and removed their duplicate implementations in SpaceMapperEngines.cs and SpaceMapperPreflightService.cs.
Build:

dotnet build /p:DeployToProgramData=false
If you want the deploy build too, close Navisworks and run dotnet build so the ProgramData copy can succeed.

Oh i meant Implement Update - ReferenceDocuments\Space_Mapper-UpdatedAdditions_20.txt - not 19 thats an old file. everything was working so make sure there hasnt been any unwanted change because i referenced the older file before


Added the new Multi‑zone “Sequence” output mode so mappings can emit Property, Property(1), Property(2)… and optionally sequence Zone Behaviour the same way when enabled.

Changes:

SpaceMapperModels.cs: added Sequence = 5 to MultiZoneCombineMode with explicit numeric values.
SpaceMapperControl.xaml: added Sequence to the CombineModes list used in templates.
SpaceMapperStepMappingPage.xaml: added Sequence to the Mapping Builder dropdown.
SpaceMapperService.cs: implemented sequenced writeback entries with a cap (MaxSequenceOutputsPerMapping = 8), plus sequenced Zone Behaviour only when any mapping uses Sequence and multi‑zone has >1 hit.
Notes on “older file” concern:

This update only affects writeback formatting and mapping UI. No containment/assignment logic changes were made here.
If you want me to undo any earlier changes from the mistaken ref (e.g., the bounds resolver refactor or the variation check button), say which ones and I’ll revert them.
Build:

dotnet build /p:DeployToProgramData=false
Optional follow‑up:

Ordering for Sequence currently follows the existing intersection order. If you want it sorted to match Step 3 resolution strategy (Most specific/Largest overlap/etc.), I can add that.
Next steps:

Run a multi‑zone case with a mapping set to Sequence and confirm TargetProperty, TargetProperty(1) are written.
Enable “Write Zone Behaviour property” and confirm Zone Behaviour(1) appears when there are multiple zones.
Tell me if you want deterministic ordering for Sequence outputs.
Implement Update - ReferenceDocuments\Space_Mapper-UpdatedAdditions_21.txt


Added the new “Write containment % property” option end‑to‑end and kept it gated so existing behavior is unchanged when the checkbox is off.

Changes:

New settings/data: SpaceMapperModels.cs (adds WriteZoneContainmentPercentProperty and ContainmentFraction).
UI toggle + help hover + midpoint disable: SpaceMapperStepProcessingPage.xaml, SpaceMapperStepProcessingPage.xaml.cs.
Settings wiring + event hooks: SpaceMapperControl.xaml.cs.
Engine computes containment fraction (mesh samples or bounds overlap) and stores it on intersections: SpaceMapperEngines.cs.
Writeback outputs Zone Containment % (sequenced when Sequence is used): SpaceMapperService.cs.
Preflight signature + needsPartial include the new setting: SpaceMapperPreflightService.cs.
Comparison runner preserves the fraction when filtering and clones the new setting: SpaceMapperComparisonRunner.cs.
Run report now shows the new setting: SpaceMapperRunReportWriter.cs.
Build:

dotnet build /p:DeployToProgramData=false
No other behavior changes were introduced outside this new, checkbox‑gated feature. When the toggle is off, the sampling and writeback paths behave as before.

Next steps:

Run a multi‑zone case with the checkbox on and verify Zone Containment % (and Zone Containment %(1) if Sequence is used).
Let me know if you want deterministic ordering for Sequence outputs (match the Step 3 resolution strategy).
User attachment
am i blind i dont see where i can enable/disable the new 'Zone Containment %' button is? or whatever you ended up calling it


It’s in Step 3 → Assignment & Writeback → Writeback Output, immediately under “Write Zone Behaviour property,” labeled “Write containment % property” with its own info icon. See SpaceMapperStepProcessingPage.xaml for the control placement.

If you don’t see it in Navisworks, you’re likely still running the older deployed plugin build. The last build you ran used /p:DeployToProgramData=false, so Navisworks never picked up the new XAML. Close Navisworks and either:

run dotnet build (deploys to ProgramData), or
manually copy the new MicroEng.Navisworks.dll into MicroEng.Navisworks.
Also note: the checkbox is auto‑disabled only when Target Bounds = Midpoint; otherwise it should be visible and enabled.

check latest report - is it possible to get a bit more accuracy on the percentage a lot say 50% but its only just touching the room by maybe 15%


Checked the latest report SpaceMapper_Run_20260103_202426_CRRTSD-250-0130-MOD-HASS-1400-510000.nwf_Doors.md. It only records the setting (Write containment % property: True) and does not list per‑target percentages, so the 50% values you’re seeing are coming from the property written to the model, not from the report itself.

Why you’re seeing ~50% for “just touching”:

The % is computed from sample points on the target AABB (not the target mesh).
With your settings (Mesh Accurate + Target bounds = Hull), we sample a 3×3×3 grid (27 points). 50% means 13–14 of those points are inside the zone. That can easily happen even if the actual geometry only grazes the zone, because the AABB includes empty space.
Yes, we can make it more accurate, but there’s a trade‑off:

Increase sampling density for the % only (e.g., 5×5×5 or 7×7×7) so the percentage is finer, without changing containment decisions.
Sample actual target geometry (triangle/fragment points) for % — most accurate, but heavier and requires extra extraction for targets.
Use AABB overlap volume for % — cheap but still coarse.
Tell me which route you want, and I’ll implement it. If you want, I can also add a small report section listing a few target IDs and their computed % so we can validate against the model.

have all these options and when you toggle Write Zone Behaviour on you can choose between which method for calculation


Added a new containment calculation picker tied to writeback outputs so you can choose how Zone Behaviour/% is computed (Auto, sampled points fast/dense, target geometry samples, or AABB overlap), and wired it through settings, reports, and engine logic. When you choose a non‑Auto method, the Zone Behaviour property uses the computed fraction (fraction < 1 ⇒ Partial), and the % output uses the same method; target‑geometry sampling uses triangle centroids (up to 200 per target) with a fallback to fast sample points if no triangles are available.

Changes:

Added the method selector panel and hover help in SpaceMapperStepProcessingPage.xaml and state wiring in SpaceMapperStepProcessingPage.xaml.cs.
Persisted the new setting and UI mapping in SpaceMapperModels.cs and SpaceMapperControl.xaml.cs.
Added target triangle extraction support in SpaceMapperGeometry.cs and conditional extraction in SpaceMapperService.cs.
Implemented calculation modes and sampling in SpaceMapperEngines.cs.
Updated behavior writeback and reporting in SpaceMapperService.cs, SpaceMapperRunReportWriter.cs, SpaceMapperPreflightService.cs, and SpaceMapperComparisonRunner.cs.
Tests:

dotnet build /p:DeployToProgramData=false
Next steps:

Open Step 3 → Assignment & Writeback and confirm the “Containment calculation” picker appears when Write Zone Behaviour or Write containment % is enabled.
Run a test with “Target geometry samples” and compare the written %/Behaviour against a known room case to see if it matches your expectations.
Implement Update - ReferenceDocuments\Space_Mapper-UpdatedAdditions_22.txt


Mesh-not-closed no longer disables mesh containment, and non‑watertight meshes now use a robust raycast path instead of falling back to bounds. The run report now separates “mesh unusable” fallback from “mesh used but not watertight” warnings, so zones like EMERGENCY EGRESS 1 should be treated as mesh‑based and reported under warnings.

What changed and where:

Stop treating MeshNotClosed as a fallback; keep triangle meshes usable and preserve closure stats in SpaceMapperGeometry.cs.
Added robust mesh containment (multi‑ray majority vote) and refactored mesh intersection helpers in SpaceMapperGeometry.cs.
Mesh containment now uses robust raycasting for non‑watertight meshes in SpaceMapperEngines.cs.
Run report now shows “non‑watertight mesh” warnings and renames fallback summary to “mesh unusable” in SpaceMapperRunReportWriter.cs.
Build:

dotnet build /p:DeployToProgramData=false
Next steps:

Run Space Mapper on the EMERGENCY EGRESS 1 case and confirm it shows under “Mesh Closure Warnings” (not fallback) in the report.
Verify door tagging behavior improves with MeshAccurate now actually using the zone mesh.
User attachment
i need more feedback as some models are not doing anything with the zones - even after 20 mins just says 0/320 zones. even if i click cancel still give a report that can give you an indicator of what is happening and why its taking so long - make sure its robust for us to resolve


Added cancellation reporting and richer progress detail so long geometry prep runs show what’s being worked on and still emit a report if you cancel. The report now always includes the live progress snapshot and stage timeline for troubleshooting.

Details

SpaceMapperService.cs: writes a report on cancel/failure (with progress snapshot), passes progress into the report on success, and updates detail text before each zone/target extraction; cached targets now mark progress as complete with a clear detail line.
SpaceMapperRunProgressState.cs: removed ^1 indexing to keep net48 compatibility.
Tests

dotnet build
Next steps

Run a slow model, cancel, and send me the newest report from C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\Navisworks Manage 2025\Plugins\MicroEng.Navisworks\Reports\ so I can review the stage timeline and last-progress timestamps.
If the progress window still sits at 0/320 for a long time, grab the “Detail” line and the report’s “Run Progress Snapshot” so we can pinpoint which zone/target is stalling.
check the latest MD file its getting stuck on a zone i think was on one of them for a long time like 20 mins then a hit stop but it took a long time for cancel to work becauyse it had to finish the current process but eventuialyl did, why did it take so long or what happened?


I checked the latest report: SpaceMapper_Run_20260104_043529_RoomTest_Boggo.nwf_Boggo_Fire.md.

What happened (from the report)

The run did NOT stall in geometry extraction; it stalled in Computing intersections.
Progress stopped at 256/320 zones. The last zone update was 17:45:26, then no progress updates until cancel finished.
You hit cancel at 18:08:26, and it didn’t stop until 18:35:29 (about 27 minutes).
That means one zone’s classification pass was extremely slow and the cancellation token wasn’t checked until that long inner loop finished.
Why cancel took so long

Cancellation is cooperative; in the intersection loop it only checks the token between iterations.
If a single zone has a huge candidate set or expensive checks (tier B hull sampling with 27 samples per target), that one zone can take minutes, and cancel waits for that zone to finish.
Evidence in the report

Zones: 256/320 and Last zone update: 17:45:26Z
Stage “Computing intersections…” started at 17:36:51Z
Cancel requested at 18:08:26Z, finished at 18:35:29Z
Mesh Accurate Tier: Tier B (Hull: multi-sample), Samples per target: 27
Zones with mesh: 0 (so it’s not mesh tests; it’s hull sample tests)
If you want, I can add two diagnostics so we can pinpoint the exact zone next time:

Include current zone name/index in the progress detail during Computing Intersections.
Add a “slow zone” log entry if a single zone takes >N seconds, recorded in the report.
yes t oboth


Added live “Computing intersections” detail so the progress window now shows the specific zone (or target in target‑major traversal) being processed, and added a slow‑zone diagnostic section to the report so long‑running zones are explicitly listed with elapsed time and candidate counts. This is wired through the engine diagnostics into the run report so you can see exactly which zone stalled and how long it ran.

Changes

SpaceMapperEngines.cs: updates progress detail with the current zone/target index + name during the intersections loop; records any zone taking >10s into a thread‑safe slow‑zone list.
SpaceMapperModels.cs: adds SpaceMapperSlowZoneInfo and new diagnostics/stats fields to carry slow‑zone data.
SpaceMapperService.cs: copies slow‑zone diagnostics into the run stats.
SpaceMapperRunReportWriter.cs: adds “Slow Zone Diagnostics” to the report with threshold and top slow zones.
Build

dotnet build
Next step

Run the same model again; the report will now include a “Slow Zone Diagnostics” section and the stage timeline detail should show the specific zone it was on when cancel was requested.
follow instructions from ReferenceDocuments\Space_Mapper-UpdatedAdditions_23.txt


DirectCompute GPU acceleration is now wired in for mesh‑accurate containment (GpuQuick/GpuIntensive), with CPU fallback for non‑mesh zones, tiny workloads, or uncertain points, plus GPU telemetry in the run report.

Details

Added SharpDX dependencies in MicroEng.Navisworks.csproj and created the compute helper in D3D11PointInMeshGpu.cs.
Replaced the placeholder GPU engine with a zone‑major GPU path, including CPU fallback and uncertain‑point correction in SpaceMapperEngines.cs.
Added GPU stats to diagnostics/run stats and report output in SpaceMapperModels.cs, SpaceMapperService.cs, and SpaceMapperRunReportWriter.cs.
Tests

dotnet build /p:DeployToProgramData=false (succeeded)
dotnet build timed out during deploy because Navisworks is locking MicroEng.Navisworks.dll.
Next steps

Run with Mesh Accurate + GpuQuick or GpuIntensive and check the “GPU Diagnostics” section in the report to confirm points/triangles/timing.
Close Navisworks (or keep using /p:DeployToProgramData=false) when you want the ProgramData deploy to succeed.
i havnt build the latest changes yet but check the md file which is from before direct compute gpu - has been running for a while, see if its working as intended


I checked the latest report: SpaceMapper_Run_20260104_152408_RoomTest_Boggo.nwf_Boggo_Fire.md. It looks like the run is working as intended, just very slow.

Key points from the report

It reached WritingProperties with all zones and targets completed: Zones 320/320, Targets 3250/3250, Writeback 2481/2481.
The “Detail” line still shows Zone 50/320… because it’s a stale value from the compute stage; writeback doesn’t update that detail.
Timings are huge: narrow‑phase 3,434,939 ms (~57.2 min) and writeback 1,517,854 ms (~25.3 min); total ~1h29m.
Slow‑zone diagnostics show several zones taking thousands of seconds even with modest candidate counts (e.g., ACCESS CORRIDOR 420.11.134 at 3187s with 279 candidates). That’s consistent with mesh‑accurate tests + target‑geometry sampling.
So: it’s not stuck in a single zone; it completed intersections and is (or was) deep in writeback. The long runtime is coming from mesh‑accurate + target‑geometry containment, and COM writeback costs.

If you want, I can add writeback‑detail updates (e.g., “Writing target X/Y”) so the progress detail stays accurate in that stage.

ok where do i find this info? - Run with Mesh Accurate + GpuQuick or GpuIntensive i dont see any GpuQuick or GpuIntensive settings where is it


It isn’t exposed in the UI right now. We previously hid the Processing Mode selector, so every run is forced to CPU Normal in SpaceMapperControl.xaml.cs. That’s why your report shows Processing mode: CpuNormal.

If you want GPU Quick/Intensive selectable, I can either:

Add a small “Processing Mode” dropdown back into Step 3 (only shown when Mesh Accurate is selected), or
Auto‑switch to GpuQuick when Mesh Accurate is on and a GPU is available (with CPU fallback if init fails).
Which do you prefer?

explain to me what the diffference between gpu quick and intesive is


GpuQuick uses a single ray per point in the compute shader. It’s faster but can misclassify edge/vertex cases because one ray can hit a triangle boundary and flip parity.

GpuIntensive fires two slightly different rays per point and only accepts the result if both rays agree; if they disagree, the point is marked “uncertain” and we fall back to CPU for that point. That’s slower, but more robust.

So:

GpuQuick = faster, slightly less robust on degenerate geometry
GpuIntensive = slower, more reliable (and safer for borderline cases)
Can you choose how many rays to use?


Not currently. Right now it’s only 1 ray (GpuQuick) or 2 rays (GpuIntensive). The shader just takes a boolean UseSecondRay.

If you want a configurable ray count, I can add it (with 1–4 as options and CPU fallback for any “uncertain” points). Do you want it exposed in the UI or as a hidden advanced default?

Yes lets have an approprate setting for GPU Ray setting where the user can specify the accuracy with a tool tip explaining and also that CPU will be used as fallback etc but internally always use GPU where possible rather than someone choosing and this can be determined by their computer system specs if they have a GPU or not etc


Added a GPU ray accuracy selector with a hover explainer and moved processing to Auto so GPU is always attempted (with CPU fallback) while preserving the chosen ray count in settings and reports.

UI + behavior: SpaceMapperStepProcessingPage.xaml, SpaceMapperStepProcessingPage.xaml.cs add the GPU ray accuracy row and show it only for Mesh Accurate, with the same hover help pattern.
Settings + pipeline: SpaceMapperModels.cs, SpaceMapperControl.xaml.cs, SpaceMapperEngines.cs, SpaceMapperPreflightService.cs add GpuRayCount, default Auto processing, and use the ray count in GPU tests.
Reporting/variation: SpaceMapperRunReportWriter.cs, SpaceMapperComparisonRunner.cs include GPU ray count in run and variation outputs.
Not run: build/tests.

Next steps:

Run dotnet build /p:DeployToProgramData=false.
In Step 3, switch to Mesh accurate and confirm the GPU ray accuracy dropdown + tooltip, then run and verify the report shows the GPU ray count.

This is a BSOD (bugcheck 0x7E = SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED) with 0xC0000005 (access violation) in kernel space. That points to a driver/hardware fault rather than an app crash. The key file is the minidump:

010426-24156-01.dmp

No Display/TDR events show up around the time, so we need the dump to see which driver/module faulted.

What I need next

The minidump above (or WinDbg output from it).
The Space Mapper run report .md from that run + exact settings (Mesh Accurate + GPU ray count, target bounds mode, etc.).
GPU model + driver version.
If you can run WinDbg Preview

Install WinDbg Preview (Microsoft Store).
Run:
windbgx -z C:\Windows\Minidump\010426-24156-01.dmp -c "!analyze -v; lm; q"
Paste the output here.

If you’d rather not install tools, you can zip and share the minidump path above and I’ll walk you through the analysis.

Thanks — this confirms it’s a BSOD 0x7E (access violation in nt!KiUpdateProcessConcurrencyCounts), with no third‑party driver shown on the stack. That usually means kernel memory corruption caused by a driver (often GPU) or hardware. We need more module context to see who’s likely at fault.

Please run these in WinDbg on that same dump and paste the output:

!analyze -v
lm t n
!thread
!process 0 1
!stacks 2
lmvm nvlddmkm
lmvm amdkmdag
lmvm igdkmd64
(Only one of the lmvm GPU drivers will exist — paste whichever one does.)

Also send:

The Space Mapper run report .md from that run.
GPU model + driver version (from Device Manager or dxdiag).
If you want more actionable data next time, switch Windows to Kernel memory dump (System Properties → Advanced → Startup and Recovery) and make sure the pagefile is on C:. That gives a fuller stack to blame a driver.

If you want a mitigation while we investigate, I can add a CPU‑only override (hidden or UI toggle).

Thanks — the dump confirms this is a BSOD (0x7E) in kernel space, not an app crash.

What the dump shows

SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED (0x7E) with 0xC0000005 (access violation).
Faulting address: nt!KiUpdateProcessConcurrencyCounts+0x17b.
That’s a kernel worker thread, and the stack doesn’t show a 3rd‑party driver (triage dumps often hide it). This usually means memory corruption, typically from a driver or hardware.
Your GPU stack: RTX 5090, driver 32.0.15.8157, WDDM 3.2, HAGS enabled, compute preemption Dispatch. Heavy D3D11 compute can trigger driver bugs on new GPUs.
Likely cause
Not a clear “our code” crash — it’s most consistent with a GPU driver/hardware issue, potentially triggered by the new compute workload.

To narrow it down

If you can, run in WinDbg:
lm t n
!stacks 2
!thread
These sometimes surface the 3rd‑party driver even in triage dumps.
Send the Space Mapper run report .md from that run (it will show settings, mesh sizes, GPU usage).
Try one isolation run:
Set GPU ray accuracy = Fast (1 ray) and Target bounds = Midpoint (lowest GPU load) and see if it still crashes.
Mitigation we can implement
If you want, I can add a safety fallback so GPU is only used when the workload is “safe” (e.g., triangle/point budget or max triangles per zone), and otherwise it auto‑falls back to CPU and logs the reason to the report. That would reduce risk without adding a visible “GPU on/off” switch.

Want me to implement that safety fallback and a report line like “GPU disabled due to workload size”?

User attachment
how do i run those comands in here where to i click or enter it?


In WinDbg, use the command input line at the bottom of the window. In your screenshot it’s the line that starts with:

kd>

Click that line, type a command, press Enter.

Run these one‑by‑one:

lm t n
!stacks 2
!thread
!process 0 1
If you want the GPU driver info too:

lmvm nvlddmkm
Then copy/paste the output here.

do i enter them individually or can i paste them all at once and hit enter


Enter them one at a time. WinDbg doesn’t reliably execute multiple lines pasted together.

If you paste several lines, it usually only runs the first. So:

type lm t n → Enter
type !stacks 2 → Enter
type !thread → Enter
type !process 0 1 → Enter
type lmvm nvlddmkm → Enter

SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED (7e)
This is a very common BugCheck. Usually the exception address pinpoints
the driver/function that caused the problem. Always note this address
as well as the link date of the driver/image that contains this address.
Arguments:
Arg1: ffffffffc0000005, The exception code that was not handled
Arg2: fffff803d0d4c87b, The address that the exception occurred at
Arg3: ffff9c8ca30cf0b8, Exception Record Address
Arg4: ffff9c8ca30ce8c0, Context Record Address

You ran it in the right place. Two things to note from your output:

!stacks 2 and !process 0 1 failed because this is a triage dump (limited structures), so that’s expected.
lmvm nvlddmkm] didn’t run because of the extra ].
Please run these one at a time in the kd> input line (no bracket):

lmvm nvlddmkm
lmvm amdkmdag
lmvm dxgkrnl
Then paste the outputs.

Also send the Space Mapper run report .md from that run (it helps correlate GPU load/settings).
