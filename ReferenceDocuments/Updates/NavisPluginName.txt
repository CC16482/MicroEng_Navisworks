In Navisworks, **“Tool add-ins 1” isn’t controlled by where you deploy the DLL**. It’s the **default ribbon host that Navisworks uses for `AddInPlugin`-style add-ins**—so if your plugin is an `AddInPlugin`, it will land there by design (“By default add-in will be shown in `Tool add-ins 1` tab”). ([TwentyTwo][1])

If you want a **dedicated, branded ribbon tab** like **Speckle** / **Revizto**, you need to change *how the UI is defined*, not just the install folder.

## What you need to do to get your own ribbon tab

### Use `CommandHandlerPlugin` (the “custom tab” plugin type)

Autodesk introduced `CommandHandlerPlugin` specifically so a plugin can **organize multiple commands in a custom ribbon tab** (i.e., a real “Speckle”-style tab). ([Autodesk Developer Blog][2])

That workflow is:

* Create a class derived from **`CommandHandlerPlugin`**
* Provide a **Ribbon layout XAML** via `[RibbonLayout("…xaml")]`
* Define the tab via `[RibbonTab("…", DisplayName="…")]` and/or in the XAML
* Define buttons/commands via `[Command("…")]`

The tab label you see in the ribbon is typically driven by the XAML’s `RibbonTab` knows as **`Title`** (“Title: defines the text that appears on the tab”). ([Autodesk Developer Blog][3])

✅ Result: you get a ribbon tab named **“MicroEng”** or **“NavisTools”** (whatever you set), instead of “Tool add-ins 1”.

> Practical pattern: keep your existing logic (dockpane, commands, etc.) and add a thin `CommandHandlerPlugin` “UI shell” that just exposes buttons and calls into your existing code.

### Alternative (less “own tab”, more “integrate into Home”)

You *can* add a panel/button into built-in tabs (e.g., **Home**) using `Autodesk.Windows` / `AdWindows.dll`, but Autodesk explicitly calls this **not official API / use-at-your-own-risk**. ([Autodesk Developer Blog][4])
This is useful if you want “Home > MicroEng panel”, but it’s not the cleanest “professional plugin tab” approach.

## Where to deploy (install) your plugin (Navisworks Manage 2025)

Deployment affects **loading**, not the ribbon tab name. These are the common/valid deployment models:

### Option A — Classic Navisworks `Plugins\` folder (simple for dev/testing)

Navisworks loads plugins from a **subfolder under `Plugins`**, and the **folder name must match the DLL name** (minus `.dll`) or it won’t load. ([ApiDocs][5])

Example:

* `C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Navisworks Manage 2025\Plugins\MicroEng.NavisTools\MicroEng.NavisTools.dll`

Navisworks literally scans `...\Plugins\*` and loads `FolderName\FolderName.dll`. ([ApiDocs][5])

Good for:

* Local development
* Quick internal deployments

Downside:

* Often requires admin rights (Program Files)
* Not the “App Store / enterprise” standard

### Option B — Per-user plugin folder (common for installers that avoid Program Files)

Some vendors install into the user roaming profile, e.g. for 2022+:

* `C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Roaming\Autodesk\Navisworks Manage 2022\Plugins\...` ([help.holobuilder.com][6])

This pattern is used by real-world Navisworks add-ins to avoid requiring admin writes to Program Files. ([help.holobuilder.com][6])
(For 2025, the equivalent pattern is typically the same “Navisworks Manage <year>\Plugins” convention under Roaming.)

### Option C — “Professional” deployment: Autodesk Autoloader `.bundle` (what Speckle-style apps typically use)

This is the standard for **App Store / enterprise-grade** packaging:

* Root: `%APPDATA%\Autodesk\ApplicationPlugins` ([Autodesk Platform Services][7])
* Create: `YourCompany.YourApp.bundle\`

  * `PackageContents.xml`
  * `Contents\... your DLLs ...`

Autodesk’s Navisworks App Store guidance explicitly documents this structure and location. ([Autodesk Platform Services][7])
Also, the general Autodesk “AppBundle” convention supports both:

* **Current user:** `%AppData%\Autodesk\ApplicationPlugins`
* **All users:** `%ProgramData%\Autodesk\ApplicationPlugins` ([ricaun - ricaun - Revit Api][8])

**This is the closest match to how Speckle/Revizto feel “first-class”** in Autodesk products (managed by App Manager / consistent deployment).

---

## Navisworks 2025-specific dev notes you should align with

* Autodesk’s App Store guidance says **Navisworks 2024+ uses .NET Framework 4.8**. Navisworks 2025 falls in that range. ([Autodesk Platform Services][7])
* Navisworks .NET API binaries are generally **major-version specific**, so you typically ship a 2025 build separately from other years if you support multiple releases. ([Autodesk Platform Services][7])

---

## Bottom line

* **No install folder will make an `AddInPlugin` stop showing under “Tool add-ins 1”.** That label comes from Navisworks’ default hosting for that plugin type. ([TwentyTwo][1])
* To look like Speckle/Revizto, implement a **`CommandHandlerPlugin` + Ribbon XAML** and define your own `RibbonTab` title. ([Autodesk Developer Blog][2])
* For “professional” deployment, package it as a **`.bundle`** under **`%APPDATA%\Autodesk\ApplicationPlugins`** (or `%ProgramData%` for all users). ([Autodesk Platform Services][7])

If you tell me what your plugin currently is (e.g., `AddInPlugin`, `DockPanePlugin`, both), I can outline the cleanest way to add a `CommandHandlerPlugin` “UI shell” that exposes your existing features under a **NavisTools** ribbon tab (without rewriting your core logic).
